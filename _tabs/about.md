The PClub Interest Groups are dedicated initiatives under the Programming Club aimed at exploring the cutting-edge and intellectually stimulating side of technology. From deep-diving into groundbreaking research papers to hosting talks on emerging tools, technologies, and unconventional ideas in computing, this space is for those who love to ask “why” and “how” beyond the surface.

We regularly organize talks by speakers on cutting edge topics in technology, followed by a discussion session creating a platform for continuous curiosity and collaboration. Open to all who are inquisitive, analytical, and eager to explore beyond the curriculum, the Interest Group fosters a vibrant, knowledge-sharing micro-community within PClub. It's where passion meets purpose — and where ideas find a voice.

At the moment, talks are being regularly conducted in the Machine Learning Interest Group, and we will soon be expanding to Systems, Information Security, Algorithms, Quantum Computing and other domains as well.
